# **UserGate**

UserGate is a RESTful API service that provides basic user management capabilities, including creating and retrieving user information. The service is built using the [**Echo**](https://github.com/labstack/echo) framework in Go, MySQL for storage, and [**goose**](https://github.com/pressly/goose) for database migrations. This project includes a CI/CD pipeline integrated with GitHub Actions and the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for streamlined testing, building, and deployment.

---

## **Features**
- **User Management**: Create and retrieve user information via RESTful APIs.
- **Database Migrations**: Manage schema changes with `goose`.
- **Echo Framework**: Provides a robust and efficient web framework for API development using `Echo`.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Build and run the application in a Dockerized environment.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated pipeline for testing, building, and deploying Docker images.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshkanShakiba/UserGate.git
   cd UserGate
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=password
   DB_NAME=usergate
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

4. Run the Dockerized environment:
   ```bash
   make docker-run
   ```

## **Usage**

The service runs on `http://localhost:8080`. You can use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API.

Example:
```bash
# Create a user
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/user' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "Name": "Anakin Skywalker"
}'

# Get a user
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/user' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "ID": 1
}'
```
